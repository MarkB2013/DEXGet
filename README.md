# DEXGet
Windows Form application that retrieves DEX audit data files from an SFTP server, and stores the data as a line in a database file to reduce quantity of files and allows for more efficient data retrieval. The program as it stands currently downloads files from two folders on an SFTP server, one folder containing text based files and the other contains ZIP files with text based files stored within them. The program will open as an empty console and will close once all files have been downloaded, the output of the console is stored with error logs in an error log directory within the workbench directory
